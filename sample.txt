Topic: Huffman Encoding

Abstract:

Data compression is a crucial tool in today's world where there exists,
increasing amounts of data that need to be transferred losslessly in 
short intervals of time. Some compression techniques encode data to a 
form where its size is reduced, transfer this compressed data and later
retrieve the original data using decompression techniques. 
When there is considerable difference in the frequencies of different 
symbols in a string, variable length codes can be assigned to the symbols 
based on their relative frequencies. By assigning shorter codes for symbols 
with a higher frequency and longer codes for thsoe with a lower frequency 
can then lead to compression of the text. More the variation in the relative 
frequencies of symbols, the more advantageous it is to use variable length 
codes for reducing the size of encoded string.
Since the codes are of variable length, it is necessary that no code is a 
prefix of another so that the codes can be properly decode. Such codes 
are called prefix code (sometimes called "prefix-free codes", that is, the 
code representing some particular symbol is never a prefix of the code
representing any other symbol). 
Huffman's algorithm is one such algorithm that computes 'prefix-free codes'
for symbols that can be conveniently accessed by means of a tree called the 
Huffman tree. In our project, we seek to implement, analyse and discuss the 
algorithm.
